# I've decided to start blogging.
Why?
Because I want to put every waking thought into text.
This is rather easy, and if people do or don't read it I don't much care. It's just out here.

I made the blog using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted it on GitHub, using the whole docs and deploy.
Ran into a few problems using submodules, and forcing git to pretend they didn't exist but otherwise it was pretty damn easy.

The blog uses markdown so I can *italicize* or **bold** I think.
it also allows for [links](https://example.org), or even code segments:

```java
// this is some java code.
System.out.println("Hello, World");
```

Which is rather cool, especially for a coding blog.

## What am I doing
I don't know. I don't know if I'll post here all the time, or never.
I'll probably post about what I'm working on or how I feel about things.

I just had the thought of creating a biking course in my backyard, because I have a lot of area.
I might blog about that too.

Mostly this will just be coding focused, and maybe some lifestlye stuff.

**Thats it.**
