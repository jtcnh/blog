# What.
So I decided to make a trail.
Why?
Because I want to get outside more, and spend less time playing games.
I want to connect with nature more. 
I also want to tame the woods, as the New Hampshire woods can be rather rough.

## Todays Work

So, what *did* I do...
<br>
Essentially, I just cleared some area.
Using a simple rake I cleared off the top layer of leaves.
I also used a shovel to remove rocks and other assorted junk on the trail.
There was a lot of ancient garbage out here, so I cleaned it up too.

## Tomorrows Work

Tomorrow, I wil most likely be working on continuing the trail further, following the level path that already exists
Fun Fact:
	My dad wanted to create a small model railroad in our backyard so I'm basically following the already pretty level guides
	*note the sticks with flagging tape attached*
	
Following these will allow me to create along a flatter, and already somewhat cleared area.
It would be much easier to remove everything and add gravel or what not, but I don't have the time, money, or love yet to do that.

Anyways.
I made a trail.
