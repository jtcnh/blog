      <description>What. So I decided to make a trail. Why? Because I want to get outside more, and spend less time playing games. I want to connect with nature more. I also want to tame the woods, as the New Hampshire woods can be rather rough.
Todays Work So, what did I do&amp;hellip; Essentially, I just cleared some area. Using a simple rake I cleared off the top layer of leaves. I also used a shovel to remove rocks and other assorted junk on the trail.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to start blogging. Why? Because I want to put every waking thought into text. This is rather easy, and if people do or don&amp;rsquo;t read it I don&amp;rsquo;t much care. It&amp;rsquo;s just out here.
I made the blog using Hugo, and hosted it on GitHub, using the whole docs and deploy. Ran into a few problems using submodules, and forcing git to pretend they didn&amp;rsquo;t exist but otherwise it was pretty damn easy.</description>
